# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Application ðŸš€
  This project is a MERN stack application that implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It allows users with different roles (e.g., admin, user, manager) to access specific features and resources based on 
  their assigned permissions.

# Features âœ¨
  - Replace the sticky note system with a digital notes app.
  - Add a public-facing page with basic contact information.
  - Provide secure employee login and a personalized welcome page.
  - Display the current user and their role.
  - Enforce weekly login requirements and provide a logout option.
  - Allow admins to revoke employee access immediately if needed.
  - Notes include ticket number, title, body, and timestamps, and can be OPEN or COMPLETED.
  - Employees can only manage their assigned notes, while managers and admins can manage all notes.
  - Only managers and admins can delete notes, access user settings, and create new users.
  - Ensure easy navigation with support for both desktop and mobile modes.
